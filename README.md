OddJob is android application built with Kotlin and Firebase. The app allows users to post local jobs to map view for other users to see and then contact the poster through the phone number posted with the job. Some additional features are user accounts along with the option for users to include a profile picture and edit their profile. The APIs used were the Google Places Autocomplete API, Google Maps SDK, and the Google geocoding API.
